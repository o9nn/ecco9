# Copilot Memories

Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store these memories but it failed so i saved them here for you :-)

Excellent! Let me now store key learnings in memory for future sessions:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "wisdom cultivation",
  "fact": "Seven-dimensional wisdom tracking uses weighted scoring: Knowledge Depth (15%), Breadth (15%), Integration (20%), Application (15%), Insight (15%), Ethics (10%), Temporal (10%)",
  "citations": "core/wisdom/seven_dimensional.go:173-180 - Overall wisdom calculation with weights",
  "reason": "This weighted scoring formula is the canonical implementation of wisdom cultivation per the Echo9 specification. Future work on wisdom systems must preserve these exact weights to maintain consistency with the Deep Tree Echo architecture. This is critical for any enhancements to the autonomous agent or wisdom tracking subsystems.",
  "category": "general"

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "identity coherence",
  "fact": "Identity coherence is calculated as: continuity × 0.30 + consistency × 0.40 + authenticity × 0.30",
  "citations": "core/echoself/coherence_tracker.go:123-126 - Coherence score calculation",
  "reason": "This formula defines how Deep Tree Echo maintains persistent identity across sessions. Consistency (behavioral alignment) has the highest weight at 40%, followed by continuity and authenticity at 30% each. This balance is crucial for the echoself system and should be preserved in any identity-related enhancements. Future modifications to identity tracking must respect these weights.",

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "memory hooks",
  "fact": "Deep Tree Echo memories must include hooks: timestamp, emotional-tone, strategic-shift, pattern-recognition, anomaly-detection, echo-signature, membrane-context",
  "citations": "core/echoself/coherence_tracker.go:43-52 - MemoryEcho struct definition",
  "reason": "These seven memory hooks are the canonical structure for storing experiences in the Deep Tree Echo system. They enable proper memory consolidation, pattern recognition, and identity persistence. Any code that stores memories or experiences should use this structure to maintain compatibility with the echoself coherence tracker and wisdom cultivation systems.",

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "documentation structure",
  "fact": "Documentation organized in docs/ with subdirs: architecture/ (design docs), iterations/ (evolution reports), analysis/ (evaluations), guides/ (tutorials), api/ (reference)",
  "citations": "docs/README.md, docs/architecture/README.md, docs/iterations/README.md, docs/analysis/README.md, docs/guides/README.md - Created comprehensive documentation structure",
  "reason": "This organization structure should be maintained for all future documentation. New architectural documents go in architecture/, iteration reports in iterations/, analysis documents in analysis/, and user-facing guides in guides/. Each category has a comprehensive README.md index. This structure was carefully designed to organize 110+ markdown files and should be preserved to maintain clarity and navigability.",

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "type system coherence",
  "fact": "Use SchedulerState (not CognitiveState) for scheduler state, CognitiveMode string type for modes, TwelveStepInferenceEngine for 12-step engines",
  "citations": "core/echobeats/scheduler.go:41-55, core/echobeats/cognitive_loop.go:65-72, core/echobeats/twelvestep.go:48-56 - Type definitions after resolving conflicts",
  "reason": "These naming conventions resolve type redeclaration conflicts in the echobeats package. The specific types were chosen to avoid conflicts: SchedulerState for the scheduler's internal state vs CognitiveState for the cognitive loop's state struct. Future modifications to echobeats must maintain these distinctions to avoid compilation errors. This is critical for build stability.",

Let me create a final summary document for this optimization work
